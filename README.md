# Daily Signal — Technical Demo
The application is available on [www.daily-signal.com](https://www.daily-signal.com/)

## Problem
A system for detecting pre-visible overload via state transitions and directive day modes.
Not conversational well-being tool, but an engine of limits.

## Status
Technical demo. No active development is planned for now

## Backlog
1. remove middleware (deprecated)
2. add optional email field to settings and save the user email
3. check if the site appears in google search
4. structure the code better

## What this project brought to me
1. I've learnt more about serverless, SQL, Tailwind
2. I've implemented Stripe, Resend first time
3. I should have deployed the site of the company

## What this project didn't brought to me, but it would be nice, if it did
1. I could have started creating a UI kit, which I would reuse in other projects
